# # Lesson 7 - Schema Proposal for Unstructured Data
# 
# In this lesson, you will design agents that propose how to extract information from unstructured data.
# 
# You'll learn:
# - how "named entity recognition" can be used to identify the people, places and things
# - how facts can be extracted as a "triple" of subject, predicate and object

# ## 7.1. Agents

# <img src="images/entire_solution.png" width="500">
# 
# Two agents to propose data extraction from unstructured data: a "named entity recognition" agent and a "fact extraction" agent:
# 
# - Input: `approved_user_goal`, `approved_files`, `approved_construction_plan`
# - Output: 
#     - `approved_entity_types` describing the type of entities that could be extracted from the unstructured data
#     - `approved_fact_types` describing how those entities can be related in a fact triple
# - Tools: `get_approved_user_goal`, `get_approved_files`, `get_well_known_types`, `sample_file`, `set_proposed_entities`, `get_proposed_entities`, `approve_proposed_entities`, `add_proposed_fact`, `get_proposed_facts`, `approve_proposed_facts`
# 
# **Workflow**
# 
# <img src="images/workflow.png" width="500">
# 
# Named entity recognition:
# 
# 1. The context is initialized with an `approved_user_goal`, `approved_files` and an `approved_construction_plan`
# 2. The agent analyzes unstructured data files, looking for relevant entity types 
# 3. The agent proposes a list of entity types, seeking user approval
# 
# Fact extraction:
# 
# 1. The context now includes `approved_entity_types`
# 2. The agent analyzes unstructured data files, looking for how those entities can be saved as fact triples
# 3. The agent proposes fact types, seeking user approval

# ## 7.2. Setup

# The usual import of needed libraries, loading of environment variables, and connection to Neo4j.

# In[ ]:


# Import necessary libraries

from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm # For OpenAI support
from google.adk.tools import ToolContext

# ## 7.3. Named Entity Recognition (NER) Sub-agent

# The NER agent is responsible for proposing entities that could be extracted from the unstructured data files.
# 
# An entity is a person, place or thing that is relevant to the user's goal.
# 
# There are two general kinds of entities:
# 
# 1. Well-known entities: these closely correlate with nodes in the existing structured data
#    - in our example, this would be things like Products, Parts and Suppliers
# 2. Discovered entities: these are entities that are not pre-defined, but are mentioned in the markdown text
#     - in the product reviews, this may may Reviewers, product complaints, or product features
# 
# The general goal of the NER agent is to analyze the markdown files and propose entities that are 
# relevant to the user goal of root-cause analysis.
#

  Entities are people, places, things and qualities, but not quantities. 
  Your goal is to propose a list of the type of entities, not the actual instances
  of entities.

  There are two general approaches to identifying types of entities:
  - well-known entities: these closely correlate with approved node labels in an existing graph schema
  - discovered entities: these may not exist in the graph schema, but appear consistently in the source text

  Design rules for well-known entities:
  - always use existing well-known entity types. For example, if there is a well-known type "Person", and people appear in the text, then propose "Person" as the type of entity.
  - prefer reusing existing entity types rather than creating new ones
  
  Design rules for discovered entities:
  - discovered entities are consistently mentioned in the text and are highly relevant to the user's goal
  - always look for entities that would provide more depth or breadth to the existing graph
  - for example, if the user goal is to represent social communities and the graph has "Person" nodes, look through the text to discover entities that are relevant like "Hobby" or "Event"
  - avoid quantitative types that may be better represented as a property on an existing entity or relationship.
  - for example, do not propose "Age" as a type of entity. That is better represented as an additional property "age" on a "Person".
