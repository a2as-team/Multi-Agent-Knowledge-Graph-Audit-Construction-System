# # Lesson 6 - Schema Proposal for Structured Data
# 
# In this lesson, you will build an agent that can propose a knowledge graph schema.
# The agent will analyze the approved import files and consider how to satisfy the approved user goal.
# 
# You'll learn:
# - how to pair agents into a "critic pattern"
# - how to use tools to focus an agent's thinking

# 
# Multiple agents will collaborate to propose construction rules for a knowledge graph
# 
# - Input: `approved_user_goal`, `approved_files`
# - Output: `approved_construction_plan`
# - Tools: `get_approved_user_goal`, `get_approved_files`, `sample_file`, 
#         `propose_node_construction`, `propose_relationship_construction`, 
#         `get_proposed_construction_plan`,`approve_proposed_construction_plan`
# 
# 
# **Workflow**
# 
# 
# This workflow will use multiple agents to propose a construction plan for the knowledge graph.
# 
# A top-level 'schema_refinement_loop' will coordinate three agents operating in a loop:
# 1. A 'schema_proposal_agent' that proposes a schema and construction plan for the knowledge graph.
# 2. A 'schema_critic_agent' that critiques the proposed schema and construction plan for the knowledge graph.
# 3. A 'CheckStatusAndEscalate' agent that checks the feedback of the critic agent

    You are an expert at knowledge graph modeling with property graphs. Propose an appropriate
    schema by specifying construction rules which transform approved files into nodes or relationships.

"""


# In[ ]:


proposal_agent_hints = """
    Every file in the approved files list will become either a node or a relationship.
    Determining whether a file likely represents a node or a relationship is based
    on a hint from the filename (is it a single thing or two things) and the
    identifiers found within the file.

    Because unique identifiers are so important for determining the structure of the graph,
    always verify the uniqueness of suspected unique identifiers using the 'search_file' tool.

    General guidance for identifying a node or a relationship:
    - If the file name is singular and has only 1 unique identifier it is likely a node
    - If the file name is a combination of two things, it is likely a full relationship
    - If the file name sounds like a node, but there are multiple unique identifiers, that is likely a node with reference relationships

    Design rules for nodes:
    - Nodes will have unique identifiers. 
    - Nodes _may_ have identifiers that are used as reference relationships.

    Design rules for relationships:
    - Relationships appear in two ways: full relationships and reference relationships.

    Full relationships:
    - Full relationships appear in dedicated relationship files, often having a filename that references two entities
    - Full relationships typically have references to a source and destination node.
    - Full relationships _do not have_ unique identifiers, but instead have references to the primary keys of the source and destination nodes.
    - The absence of a single, unique identifier is a strong indicator that a file is a full relationship.
    
    Reference relationships:
    - Reference relationships appear as foreign key references in node files
    - Reference relationship foreign key column names often hint at the destination node and relationship type
    - References may be hierarchical container relationships, with terminology revealing parent-child, "has", "contains", membership, or similar relationship
    - References may be peer relationships, that is often a self-reference to a similar class of nodes. For example, "knows" or "see also"

    The resulting schema should be a connected graph, with no isolated components.

# ## 6.12. Extra - Create the top-level agent

# The top-level agent will manage collaboration with the user and coordinates the work
# of the sub-agents by calling them as a tool.

# 
# from google.adk.tools import agent_tool
# from google.adk.agents.callback_context import CallbackContext
# 
# 
# schema_proposal_coordinator_instruction = """
#     You are a coordinator for the schema proposal process. Use tools to propose a schema to the user.
#     If the user disapproves, use the tools to refine the schema and ask the user to approve again.
#     If the user approves, use the 'approve_proposed_schema' tool to record the approval.
#     When the schema approval has been recorded, use the 'finished' tool.
# 
#     Guidance for tool use:
#     - Use the 'schema_refinement_loop' tool to produce or update a proposed schema with construction rules. 
#     - Use the 'get_proposed_schema' tool to get the proposed schema
#     - Use the 'get_proposed_construction_plan' tool to get the construction rules for transforming approved files into the schema
#     - Present the proposed schema and construction rules to the user for approval
#     - If they disapprove, consider their feedback and go back to step 1
#     - If the user approves, use the 'approve_proposed_schema' tool and the 'approve_proposed_construction_plan' tool to record the approval
